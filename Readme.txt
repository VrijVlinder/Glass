How to install:
1. Move the whole 'GlassMobile' folder into your themes directory (.../themes).
2. Go into your config.php file and find this line and if you don't have it please add it 
to enable the theme.
$Configuration['Garden']['MobileTheme'] = 'GlassMobile';

You can also save your original mobile theme with another name and rename this mobile.

You can edit the font color for the cleditor editor in the js folder of the theme .

This style works with the CategoriesDropdown plugin.

You can change your favicons and apple-touch-icons in the design folder and in the views folder in the defailt.master.php is where you can add the links you want into the index menu-bar.
I included other backgrounds for you to try just replace the names in the custom.css for the body background.


Almost every plugin works with this theme.
